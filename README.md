# "Ovalchomp" Art Site | [Live preview](https://artsite.circlejourney.net)

An art website-in-progress, built in Laravel. It uses the following front-end libraries: jQuery, jQuery Sortable, Ace. All other work is original.

This is a project that I'm working on in collaboration with [YoctoCrunch](https://toyhou.se/YoctoCrunch) as the graphic and UI/UX designer. It's being made public for portfolio purposes, but for the time being, all rights are reserved.
